This guide shows what each one is actually for, and what happens when you run them together.\n\n• Claude Chat — Think — brainstorming, drafts, thinking out loud\n• Claude Cowork — Organize — work across your files and apps\n• Claude Code — Build — describe it in plain English, get a working tool",

What changes is how much they can touch and how much they can do on their own.\n\nChat lives in a conversation. Cowork steps out of the chat and onto your computer, working with your real files and apps. Code goes one level deeper and builds new things from scratch.",

        body: "Anything you would hand to a sharp junior person to figure out.\n\nThis is the Claude most people already know. You open the app or website, type, and get answers back. Nothing happens to your computer and nothing gets built. The output lives inside the chat.\n\nWhere it lives: Web, mobile, and desktop app.\nWhat it touches: Just the conversation — what you paste or upload.\nHow it works: Back and forth. You ask, it answers, you steer.\nBest for: Thinking, drafting, learning, and quick analysis.\n\nWhat it is great at:\n• Brainstorming angles, names, hooks, and directions\n• Drafting copy, emails, scripts, outlines, and first versions\n• Explaining hard things simply, or teaching at your pace\n• Pressure-testing decisions out loud\n• Reading a document or image and pulling out what matters\n\nReal-life examples:\n• Creator: \"Give me 10 hook ideas for a reel on AI tools, then write the strongest one as a 45 second script.\"\n• Founder: \"Here is my rough pitch. Poke holes in it and tell me what an investor would push back on.\"\n• Learner: \"Explain how APIs work like I am completely new, then quiz me on it.\"\n\nWorth knowing: Chat cannot reach into your computer, send things for you, or build a working tool. When a task needs Claude to actually do something with your files or apps, you have outgrown Chat.",

You describe an outcome, it plans the steps, and it goes and does them while you steer. Claude Code for the rest of your work — same get-it-done engine, pointed at everyday knowledge work, no terminal required.\n\nThe difference from Chat: someone telling you how vs handing you the finished result.\n\nWhere it lives: Claude desktop app on your machine. Reachable from mobile too.\nWhat it touches: Local files and folders, connected apps (Google Drive, Gmail), browser via Chrome extension.\nHow it works: You give a task, it plans and runs across multiple steps.\nBest for: High-effort, repeatable work that eats time but is not technically hard.\n\nWhat it is great at:\n• Cleaning up chaos — renaming, sorting, deduplicating downloads and drafts\n• Turning scattered source files into one structured draft, report, or brief\n• Pulling data out of screenshots or documents into a spreadsheet\n• Multi-step jobs across files, browser, and connected apps\n• Tedious tasks that usually get skipped\n\nReal-life examples:\n• Creator: \"Go through this folder of receipt screenshots and turn them into one expense spreadsheet.\"\n• Founder: \"Read these five call notes and the proposal draft, then assemble a clean one-pager for the client.\"\n• Operator: \"Sort my downloads folder, rename everything sensibly, and tell me what is safe to delete.\"\n\nWorth knowing: Cowork asks permission before touching an app, you can see what it is doing, and stop it at any step.

Describe what you want the way you would explain it to a new employee — Code plans, writes files, runs them, and fixes itself when something breaks.\n\nIf you can describe it clearly, Code can usually build it.\n\nWhere it lives: Command line for developers, plus desktop and mobile apps.\nWhat it touches: Your project files — reads, writes, runs code, connects to outside tools.\nHow it works: Describe a goal, it plans, builds across files, tests, and iterates.\nBest for: Building anything custom that does not exist yet, or fixing what does.\n\nWhat it is great at:\n• Building a real website, landing page, or small app from a description\n• Automations that do a repetitive job on a schedule\n• Custom tools you would otherwise pay a developer to build\n• Browser extensions and connecting services together\n• Debugging — paste an error and let it trace and fix the cause\n\nReal-life examples:\n• Creator: \"Build me a simple waitlist page where people enter their email, with clean branding.\"\n• Founder: \"I wanted an invoice tracker. Describe it once and Code builds a working version.\"\n• Operator: \"Build a script that renames and resizes every image in this folder.\"\n\nWorth knowing: Code is the most powerful of the three.

Build slide deck and participant pack, draft welcome emails, organize into a clean folder.\n\n3. Code (Build) — Ship the tools. Branded signup page that collects emails, automation that sends the welcome sequence.\n\nChat to think. Cowork to organize. Code to build. That is the full system.\n\nOne person running a launch that used to take a team — not because any single tool is magic, but because you move work between all three.",

Open the desktop app and point Cowork at a single cluttered folder.\n2. Ask it to sort and rename everything sensibly.\n3. Watch how it plans, approve the steps, and let it finish.\n\nCode — build one tiny thing:\n1. Pick the smallest useful tool you wish you had.\n2.

The risk I need to watch: The single biggest risk from the Contrarian and peer review that I must actively manage.\n4.

Be specific with your question. \"Should I launch this product?\" is weak. \"Should I launch this AI writing tool for freelancers at $29/mo in Q3, given that I have $8k in runway and no audience yet?\" gives the advisors real constraints to work with.\n\n2. Don't skip Stage 2. The peer review is where the real value lives. Without it, you just have five separate opinions. With it, you have five opinions that have been stress-tested against each other.\n\n3. Pay attention to the collective blind spot. When you ask \"What did all five miss?\", Claude will often surface something none of the individual advisors thought to address. That gap is frequently the most important factor.\n\n4. Run it on decisions, not questions. This works best when you have a specific fork in the road: launch or wait, hire or outsource, pivot or double down. For pure information gathering, a regular Claude conversation is fine.\n\n5. Use the Chairman's output as a starting point. The council gives you structured thinking, not a replacement for your judgment. The value is in the angles it surfaces, not in outsourcing the decision itself.",
